// ARRAYS
// Arrays
// Organizing and storing data is a foundational concept of programming.

// One way we organize data in real life is by making lists. Let’s make one here:

// New Year's Resolutions:

// 1. Keep a journal 
// 2. Take a falconry class
// 3. Learn to juggle
// Let’s now write this list in JavaScript, as an array:

// let newYearsResolutions = ['Keep a journal', 'Take a falconry class', 'Learn to juggle'];
// Arrays are JavaScript’s way of making lists. Arrays can store any data types (including strings, numbers, and booleans). Like lists, arrays are ordered, meaning each item has a numbered position.

// Here’s an array of the concepts we’ll cover:

// let concepts = ['creating arrays', 'array structures', 'array manipulation']
// By the end of this lesson you’ll have another tool under your belt that helps you manage chunks of data!

// Instructions
// Run the code to see what is logged to the console.

let newYearsResolutions = ['Keep a journal', 'Take a falconry class', 'Learn to juggle'];

console.log(newYearsResolutions);




ARRAYS
// Create an Array
// One way we can create an array is to use an array literal. An array literal creates an array by wrapping items in square brackets []. Remember from the previous exercise, arrays can store any data type — we can have an array that holds all the same data types or an array that holds different data types.

// Diagram outlining an array literal that has 3 separate elements, a comma separates each element (a string, a number, and a boolean) and the elements are wrapped with square brackets
// Let’s take a closer look at the syntax in the array example:

// The array is represented by the square brackets [] and the content inside.
// Each content item inside an array is called an element.
// There are three different elements inside the array.
// Each element inside the array is a different data type.
// We can also save an array to a variable. You may have noticed we did this in the previous exercise:

// let newYearsResolutions = ['Keep a journal', 'Take a falconry class', 'Learn to juggle'];
// Let’s practice by making an array of our own.

// Instructions
// 1.
// Declare a variable using const named hobbies and set it equal to an array with three strings inside of it.


// Stuck? Get a hint
// 2.
// Use console.log() to print hobbies to the console.


const hobbies = ['gaming','photos','foodies'];
console.log(hobbies)


// ARRAYS
// Accessing Elements
// Each element in an array has a numbered position known as its index. We can access individual items using their index, which is similar to referencing an item in a list based on the item’s position.

// Arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed, meaning the positions start counting from 0 rather than 1. Therefore, the first item in an array will be at position 0. Let’s see how we could access an element in an array:

// Diagram outlining how to access the property of an array using the index of the element
// In the code snippet above:

// cities is an array that has three elements.
// We’re using bracket notation, [] with the index after the name of the array to access the element.
// cities[0] will access the element at index 0 in the array cities. You can think of cities[0] as accessing the space in memory that holds the string 'New York'.
// You can also access individual characters in a string using bracket notation and the index. For instance, you can write:

// const hello = 'Hello World';
// console.log(hello[6]);
// // Output: W
// The console will display W since it is the character that is at index 6.

// Instructions
// 1.
// Individual elements in arrays can also be stored to variables.

// Create a variable named listItem and set it equal to the first item in the famousSayings array using square bracket notation ([]).

// Then use console.log() to print the listItem variable to the console.


// Stuck? Get a hint
// 2.
// Now, console.log() the third element in the famousSayings array using bracket notation to access the element.

// Do not save the element to a new variable before you log it.


// Stuck? Get a hint
// 3.
// Awesome, you can access each element in an array using the index. But what happens if you try to access an index that is beyond the last element?

// Try to log the item at index [3] of famousSayings to the console. What is logged to the console?


const famousSayings = ['Fortune favors the brave.', 'A joke is a very serious thing.', 'Where there is love there is life.'];

const listItem = famousSayings[2];
console.log(famousSayings[3])



// ARRAYS
// Update Elements
// In the previous exercise, you learned how to access elements inside an array or a string by using an index. Once you have access to an element in an array, you can update its value.

// let seasons = ['Winter', 'Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall'];
 
// seasons[3] = 'Autumn';
// console.log(seasons); 
// //Output: ['Winter', 'Spring', 'Summer', 'Autumn']
// In the example above, the seasons array contained the names of the four seasons.

// However, we decided that we preferred to say 'Autumn' instead of 'Fall'.

// The line, seasons[3] = 'Autumn'; tells our program to change the item at index 3 of the seasons array to be 'Autumn' instead of what is already there.

// Instructions
// 1.
// Change the second element of the array groceryList to 'avocados'.

let groceryList = ['bread', 'avocados', 'milk'];


ARRAYS
// Arrays with let and const
// You may recall that you can declare variables with both the let and const keywords. Variables declared with let can be reassigned.

// Variables declared with the const keyword cannot be reassigned. However, elements in an array declared with const remain mutable. Meaning that we can change the contents of a const array, but cannot reassign a new array or a different value.

// The instructions below will illustrate this concept more clearly. Pay close attention to the similarities and differences between the condiments array and the utensils array as you complete the steps.

// Instructions
// 1.
// Below the two existing arrays, re-assign the element in index 0 of condiments to 'Mayo'.

// Log the updated array, condiments, to the console.


// Stuck? Get a hint
// 2.
// Below your code from Step 1, reassign condiments to be a new array that contains a single string ['Mayo']

// Log the result to the console.

// Notice that you can re-assign elements in an array and re-assign an entire new array to a variable declared using the let keyword.


// Stuck? Get a hint
// 3.
// Below your code from Step 2, re-assign the last item from the utensils array to 'Spoon'.

// Log the updated array to the console.


// 

let condiments = ['Ketchup', 'Mustard', 'Soy Sauce', 'Sriracha'];

const utensils = ['Fork', 'Knife', 'Chopsticks', 'Spork'];

condiments[0] = ('Mayo');
console.log(condiments)


// ARRAYS
// The .length property
// One of an array’s built-in properties is length and it returns the number of items in the array. We access the .length property just like we do with strings. Check the example below:

// const newYearsResolutions = ['Keep a journal', 'Take a falconry class'];
 
// console.log(newYearsResolutions.length);
// // Output: 2
// In the example above, we log newYearsResolutions.length to the console using the following steps:

// We use dot notation, chaining a period with the property name to the array, to access the length property of the newYearsResolutions array.
// Then we log the length of newYearsResolution to the console.
// Since newYearsResolution has two elements, so 2 would be logged to the console.
// When we want to know how many elements are in an array, we can access the .length property.

// Instructions
// 1.
// Find the length of the objectives array and log it to the console.




const objectives = ['Learn a new languages', 'Read 52 books', 'Run a marathon'];

console.log(objectives.length)


ARRAYS
// The .push() Method
// Let’s learn about some built-in JavaScript methods that make working with arrays easier. These methods are specifically called on arrays to make common tasks, like adding and removing elements, more straightforward.

// One method, .push() allows us to add items to the end of an array. Here is an example of how this is used:

// const itemTracker = ['item 0', 'item 1', 'item 2'];
 
// itemTracker.push('item 3', 'item 4');
 
// console.log(itemTracker); 
// // Output: ['item 0', 'item 1', 'item 2', 'item 3', 'item 4'];
// So, how does .push() work?

// We access the push method by using dot notation, connecting push to itemTracker with a period.
// Then we call it like a function. That’s because .push() is a function and one that JavaScript allows us to use right on an array.
// .push() can take a single argument or multiple arguments separated by commas. In this case, we’re adding two elements: 'item 3' and 'item 4' to itemTracker.
// Notice that .push() changes, or mutates, itemTracker. You might also see .push() referred to as a destructive array method since it changes the initial array.
// If you’re looking for a method that will mutate an array by adding elements to it, then .push() is the method for you!

// Instructions
// 1.
// Add two elements to the chores array using .push().

// Checkpoint 2 Passed

// Stuck? Get a hint
// 2.
// Use console.log to print your chores array to make sure your items were added.

// 
const chores = ['wash dishes', 'do laundry', 'take out trash'];


chores.push('laundry','wash car')
console.log(chores)

ARRAYS
// The .pop() Method
// Another array method, .pop(), removes the last item of an array.

// const newItemTracker = ['item 0', 'item 1', 'item 2'];
 
// const removed = newItemTracker.pop();
 
// console.log(newItemTracker); 
// // Output: [ 'item 0', 'item 1' ]
// console.log(removed);
// // Output: item 2
// In the example above, calling .pop() on the newItemTracker array removed item 2 from the end.
// .pop() does not take any arguments, it simply removes the last element of newItemTracker.
// .pop() returns the value of the last element. In the example, we store the returned value in a variable removed to be used for later.
// .pop() is a method that mutates the initial array.
// When you need to mutate an array by removing the last element, use .pop().

// Instructions
// 1.
// Use the .pop() method to remove the last element from chores.

// Checkpoint 2 Passed

// Stuck? Get a hint
// 2.
// In a line after you called chores.pop(), log chores to the console to make sure it worked.



const chores = ['wash dishes', 'do laundry', 'take out trash', 'cook dinner', 'mop floor'];



chores.pop();
console.log(chores);

ARRAYS
// More Array Methods
// There are many more array methods than just .push() and .pop(). You can read about all of the array methods that exist on the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) array documentation.

// .pop() and .push() mutate the array on which they’re called. However, there are times that we don’t want to mutate the original array and we can use non-mutating array methods. Be sure to check MDN to understand the behavior of the method you are using.

// Some arrays methods that are available to JavaScript developers include: .join(), .slice(), .splice(), .shift(), .unshift(), and .concat() amongst many others. Using these built-in methods make it easier to do some common tasks when working with arrays.

// Below, we will explore some methods that we have not learned yet. We will use these methods to edit a grocery list. As you complete the steps, you can consult the MDN documentation to learn what each method does!

// Instructions
// 1.
// Use the .shift() method to remove the first item from the array groceryList.

// Log the new groceryList to the console.

// Read about .shift() at MDN’s shift documentation.

// Checkpoint 2 Passed

// Stuck? Get a hint
// 2.
// Under the code added in step 1, use the .unshift() method to add 'popcorn' to the beginning of your grocery list.

// After calling .unshift() on groceryList, log groceryList to the console.

// You may wish to delete the console.log() statement from the previous step.

// Read about .unshift() at MDN’s unshift documentation.

// Checkpoint 3 Passed

// Stuck? Get a hint
// 3.
// You’re in a hurry so you decide to ask a friend to help you with your grocery shopping. You want him to pick up the 'bananas', 'coffee beans', and 'brown rice'.

// Under the code you added for step 2, use .slice() to provide your friend with a list of these three things.

// Log this part of the list to the console. Unlike the two previous checkpoints, you should do both of these steps in one line.

// Read about .slice() at MDN’s slice documentation.

// Checkpoint 4 Passed

// Hint
// Your code will look similar to this:

// console.log(array.method(first, last+1));
// 4.
// After calling .slice() on groceryList, log the grocery list to the console one more time.

// Notice that the groceryList array still contains the same items it had in Step 2. That means .slice() is non-mutating! You can confirm this in the link in the previous step.

// Checkpoint 5 Passed

// Stuck? Get a hint
// 5.
// Let’s find the index of a particular element in groceryList using .indexOf().

// Call .indexOf() on groceryList to find the index of the element 'pasta' and save the returned value to a const variable named pastaIndex.

// Then log pastaIndex to the console. (You may remove the other console.log() statements to declutter the terminal.)

// Read about .indexOf() at MDN’s indexOf documentation.


const groceryList = ['orange juice', 'bananas', 'coffee beans', 'brown rice', 'pasta', 'coconut oil', 'plantains'];

groceryList.shift();
// console.log(groceryList);

groceryList.unshift('popcorn');
// console.log(groceryList);

console.log(groceryList.slice(1,4));
console.log(groceryList);

const pastaIndex = groceryList.indexOf('pasta') 
console.log(pastaIndex)
